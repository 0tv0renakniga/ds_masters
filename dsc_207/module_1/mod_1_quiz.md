## Question 3
**Veracity in 5V's of big data refers to**

⬜ Size of the data  
⬜ Influx rate of data  
⬜ Authenticity/Correctness of data  
⬜ Diversity of the data  
⬜ Actionable insights from data  

<details>
<summary><strong>Correct Answer:</strong></summary>

✅ Authenticity/Correctness of data

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
**Explanation:** The 5V's of big data are:
- Volume (size of data)
- Velocity (influx rate of data)
- Variety (diversity of data)
- Veracity (authenticity/correctness of data)
- Value (actionable insights from data)

Veracity specifically addresses the trustworthiness and accuracy of data, which becomes increasingly important as data volumes grow.

## Question 4
**Team collaboration is an important aspect of data science**

⬜ True  
⬜ False  

<details>
<summary><strong>Correct Answer:</strong></summary>

✅ True

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Data science projects typically require diverse expertise including domain knowledge, statistical skills, programming abilities, and business acumen. Effective collaboration across these different skill sets is essential for successful data science initiatives.
</details>

## Question 5
**Why is Python so popular in Data Science? (select all that apply)**

⬜ Python provides powerful libraries for data science  
⬜ Python is open source  
⬜ Python holds 65% share of primary programming language for data science  
⬜ Python is used as "glue language"  
⬜ Python is the only language that supports data science  
⬜ Python is compiled language

<summary><strong>Correct Answers:</strong></summary>

✅ Python provides powerful libraries for data science  
✅ Python is open source  
✅ Python holds 65% share of primary programming language for data science  
✅ Python is used as "glue language"  
⬜ Python is the only language that supports data science  
⬜ Python is compiled language  

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Python's popularity in data science stems from its extensive ecosystem of specialized libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.), its open-source nature making it accessible, its widespread adoption in the field, and its versatility in connecting different tools and languages as a "glue language." Python is an interpreted language, not compiled, and while popular, it's certainly not the only language used in data science (R, Julia, and SQL are also widely used).

## Question 6
**As per the video, what are some of the reasons for Netflix to adopt Jupyter Notebooks? (select all that apply)**

⬜ Sharing of prepared queries and visualizations  
⬜ Standardized data access between multiple teams  
⬜ IDE integrations  
⬜ Parameterized notebooks allowed running experiments with different coefficients  
⬜ Helped in reducing security concerns

✅ Sharing of prepared queries and visualizations  
✅ Standardized data access between multiple teams  
⬜ IDE integrations  
✅ Parameterized notebooks allowed running experiments with different coefficients  
⬜ Helped in reducing security concerns  

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
According to the course material, Netflix adopted Jupyter Notebooks primarily to enhance collaboration through shared queries and visualizations, standardize data access across teams, and enable efficient experimentation through parameterized notebooks. These capabilities support Netflix's data-driven decision-making processes.

## Question 7
**What is the correct order of phases of a data science project**

⬜ Acquire, Process, Act, Analyze, Report  
⬜ Analyze, Acquire, Process, Act, Report  
⬜ Acquire, Analyze, Process, Act, Report  
⬜ Acquire, Process, Analyze, Report, Act  
⬜ Analyze, Acquire, Act, Process, Report  

<details>
<summary><strong>Correct Answer:</strong></summary>

✅ Acquire, Process, Analyze, Report, Act

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The standard data science workflow follows this logical sequence:
1. **Acquire**: Gather and collect relevant data
2. **Process**: Clean, transform, and prepare the data
3. **Analyze**: Apply statistical methods and models to extract insights
4. **Report**: Communicate findings through visualizations and narratives
5. **Act**: Implement decisions or changes based on the insights

This sequence ensures that insights are based on properly prepared data and that findings lead to actionable outcomes.
</details>

## Question 8
**Data science phases can be an iterative process**

⬜ True  
⬜ False  

<details>
<summary><strong>Correct Answer:</strong></summary>

✅ True

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Data science rarely follows a strictly linear path. As new insights emerge or challenges arise, data scientists often need to revisit earlier phases. For example, analysis might reveal the need for additional data (returning to Acquire) or different preprocessing approaches (returning to Process). This iterative nature allows for continuous refinement and improvement of results.
